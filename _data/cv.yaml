########### Profile ###########
profile: "I work across academia, industry, and the arts to understand our media present and to build its future. I&rsquo;m a skilled collaborator, with experience in project management, grant administration, events planning, and digital outreach. I&rsquo;m trained in the arts, humanities, and information sciences, and I can speak fluently the languages of the classroom, gallery, and command line. In my academic work and teaching, I investigate electronic literature, media archaeology, and software studies—in short, the textual and material history of media forms and technologies."
