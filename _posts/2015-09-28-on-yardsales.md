> You will advertise the yard sale as starting at 9:00 AM. You will plan your days leading up to the yard sale blissfully ensconced in the absolute fixity of that reality; you will distribute printed matter, set alarms, make previous-night-drinking decisions based upon the assumed reality that you will begin selling your shit at 9:00 AM. This is, in fact, a lie. A lie you tell yourself so that you may feel that the world, your world, is somehow regular, explainable, controllable. The yard sale begins when the first old man in a hatchback rolls up and knocks on your apartment buildingâ€™s door. This will be at 7:15 AM.

Are you interested in the affective experience of selling your garbage on the street? [Boy, did I write something for you.](http://detritus.website/words/concepts/yardsale/)
