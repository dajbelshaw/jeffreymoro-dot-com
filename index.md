# Hi, I'm Jeffrey Moro.

I'm currently seeking my PhD in English at [University of Maryland, College Park](http://english.umd.edu), where I'm also the Site Manager for [Romantic Circles](https://www.rc.umd.edu), a refereed scholarly website on Romantic-period literature and culture. [In my research](/research), I work in the digital humanities and digital studies on topics across electronic literature, media archaeology, and software studies. I'm interested in the textual and material history of media forms and technologies, particularly in relationship to political practice, obsolescence, waste, sustainability, infrastructure, affect, care/repair, and crisis.

Past lives include: post-baccalaureate resident for [Five College Digital Humanities](http://5colldh.org) and degrees in English and Theater & Dance from [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu). 

On this corner of the Internet, you can [see some of my work](/research), [check out my CV](/cv), or [read some blog posts](/blog). I'm available for freelance consultations and collaborations on a variety of digital projects; my email address is available by clicking the envelope in the menu to your left (or above, depending on the size and orientation of your computing device of choice!). And if you'd rather watch a video of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaE-LwDowcU" target="blank">octopus carrying a coconut</a>, well, who would blame you?
