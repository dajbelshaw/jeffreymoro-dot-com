# Hi, I'm Jeffrey Moro.

I'm currently seeking my PhD in English at the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://english.umd.edu). [In my research](/research), I work in the digital humanities and digital studies on topics across media history and archaeology, networks and control, platforms and infrastructures, and the textuality of code. In particular, I concentrate on digital studies' relationships to critical theory, political practice, materialisms, ecology, waste, and repair. I'm also Site Manager for [Romantic Circles](https://www.rc.umd.edu), a refereed scholarly website on Romantic-period literature and culture.

Past lives include: post-baccalaureate resident for [Five College Digital Humanities](http://5colldh.org) and degrees in English and Theater & Dance from [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu). 

On this corner of the Internet, you can [see some of my work](/research), [check out my CV](/cv), or [read some blog posts](/blog). Though if you'd rather watch a video of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaE-LwDowcU" target="blank">octopus carrying a coconut</a>, well, who would blame you?
